# DS-ML

I am an enthusiast who is always eager to learn new things, and proficient in data mining, data modelling, calculation, and visualization using Tableau, MS Excel, and Python libraries. I have in-depth knowledge of data structures and algorithms (Array, Linked List, Stacks, Queues, OOPS, Trees, Binary Trees, BST, Priority Queues, HashMap, Tries, and so on), and a logical and mathematical understanding of all popular ML algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, including Regression, K-means, KNN, Decision Tree, PCA, NLP, and Anomaly detection. 


Project: Retrieval of Unique Quora Queries
NLP | Scikit-Learn | Seaborn | Matplotlib | NumPy | Pandas | Python
• Used Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict the uniqueness of Quora queries by merging duplicate questions pairs.
• Reduced dimensionality using TNSE, enhanced accuracy through tokenization and extraction of length and fuzzy features.

Project: Personal Loan Modelling for Liable Customers
Scikit-Learn | NumPy | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Python
• Performed EDA, and generated insights by univariate and bivariate analysis on different attributes with the banking dataset of Kaggle.
• Detected outliers by the IQR method and visualised them using box plots, and developed a correlation matrix heatmap by creating dummies.
• Used Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM models to predict which customers would take personal loans.


Project: InstaBot for Food Blogging Handle
BeautifulSoup| Selenium | NumPy | Pandas | Matplotlib | Python
• Developed Python-based automated Instagram bot made for shifting through profiles to extract the relevant information.
• Features of the bot allow prioritisation of profiles based on followers and analyse the frequency of each word in hashtags.
• Identified top 10 posts of the top 5 handles; plotted each handle with the ratio of average likes and followers.

Project: Case Study (StartUp)
This is the case study of data analysis using python libraries ( NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).

Project: TMDb API
For this project, I am using the TMDb (The Movie Database) API, which enables to find out the latest information about TV Shows, Movies and the biggest names in entertainment sector for a marvelous and fun TV/Movie watching experience. TMDb documentation link: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction. After joining TMDb, we can easily generate a new developer API key using this link: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api/request

My Motivation for using TMDb API:
- By collecting the data using TMDb API, we can recommend TV Shows, Movies and all sorts of entertainment on the basis of user’s affinity to specific genres, actors, likes and dislikes. 
- We can find details about upcoming TV Shows and Movies. 
- We can find what is the most popular and/ or exclusive/new content at a given time.
